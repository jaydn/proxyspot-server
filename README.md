## version: 2 (prev. animus)

* flexible
* full login system
* light on resources

## asynchronous, in a sense
fire off as many requests as you can with the python client and let the server handle them as they come in. you could run millions through this system with the same memory consumption since all the hard work is done by the backend.

## light
no insane dependencies. should run on vanilla php with the pdo thing.

## i'm pretty bad at php
if things are broken i wouldn't be surprised.
